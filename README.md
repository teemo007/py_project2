Using python to scrape the heights of men and women players among volleyball and swimming and diving rosters from 40 URLs. 
I can obtain the different sport type of playerâ€™s names and heights. 
Analyze and use these data to compare the average height of the swimming team with the average height of the volleyball team and draw conclusions. 
Finally, get the average heights of the players and present them as a visual plot chart
